Project-Smash-Attacks
=====================


This repo serves as a place where interested parties may find and easily modify the source code in an attempt to further the functionality of the application. While other tools have been developed since its creation, PSA has been a comfortable and familiar interface for editing the character files, and therefor i believe still has potential to improve


Future Plans
=====================
Article support  
Fighter.pac support  
Item support  
SSE attribute support  
Adding external subroutines  
Data explorer / Tree view
